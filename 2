 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while riding an article for italian wired i always keep my pass handy never writing anything but
 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless rat
 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
 run down worn out weakened impotent cast rated paralyzed handicapped
 seen i off decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up count it out
 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
 i was reading less out loud to a friend and if fer was laughing it was so lucre s but i just got him have mangled
 spurn my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
 ah and in impact that the assault from these words unleashed
 i don't i'm f four cause they is my raggedy old bazaar some thinking this must be an ancient prince date right but in fact a print a was the early nighte in dies
 when i would have been a starting primary school in forming and understanding of myself outside the family unit and has related to the other kids in the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using at the source back then
 i ain't from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived some one like me to have nothing it positive whatsoever going said them when its acid day
 i'm celebrated fur the opportunities and adventures my life have procured so im i immediately
 went to look up a two thousand nine on line edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the opted version of this entry
 unfortunately it's not much better and i find be the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
 so it's not u about the worse
 what we believe about people when we name them with these words about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
 and how we view the world and how we view other people if that many ancient societies including the greeks in the romans believed that to utter a curse
 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or person whose empowered
 by casually doing something as a symbol is naming a person a child
 we might be pudding lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want a open doors said emmon stead
 once a person who open doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i di pon institute in wilmington delaware the name of doctor piqued t til out
 a ten uncalled american whose name of hearty was too difficult for most american to pronounce so you want by doctor p and doctor p
 always wore really colorful bow ties and um had the very perfect disposition to work with children
 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital wished the exception of my cynical fair accessions
 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with beast thick elastic bands at different colors you know
 to help build up my leg muscle and i hate of youse bands more than anything i hated them had named for them i hated them and
 he know i was already bargaining at the fighter old child with doctor pete trot get out of doing his exercises unsuccessfully of course
 and one day he came in to my session am exhaustive and unforgiving
 the sessions and he said to me well amy you are such a strong powerful little girl
 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break in i m to give you a hundred box now course if this was a simple boy
 on doctor peas parks he'd get me did you be exercise as i didn't want to do before the crossman could being the richest fighter old in the second floor ward
 but what he affected we did for me was re shade an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
 and a half to wonder to day to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
 as a strong and powerful little girl shape my own view of myself and inherently strong powerful an athletic person well into the future
 this is an example of how adults and positions of power can ignite the power of a child
 but in the previous instances of those b czar century yet our language is allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
 know the possibility of an individual to see themselves is capable
 our language hin caught up with the changes in our society many of which he been brought about by technology certainly your amenable standpoint
 my legs a note later surgery for a vision impairment a titania knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature supposed on them
 not to mention social net working platforms allows people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go line with global groups of their own choosing
 a perhaps acknowledges revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest aft a human ability to adapt an interesting thing because people
 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
 anne eminent make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
 implicit in this graze of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
 is about emerging on the other side of a talented experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side step or circumnavigate the presumed pit balls of a life with prospects and when other people perceives my disability
 who in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and ominous suggestive this is a good thing
 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
 and i tell to think of it like my shadow sometimes i feel out of it sometimes there's very little that it's always with me
 i certainly i'm not trying to diminish but impact the weight of a person struggle there is
 adverse toy and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you get amid adversity but how your going to meet it
 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
 can we do it a service to our kids when we make them seal that theyre not acquit to a doubt
 there's an important difference and distinction between the object of medical fact of my being an empery and the subjective social opinion of whether or not undazed
 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront as the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
 for indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
 disabled some one perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
 we are effectively grating someone's worth dark community so we need to seep through the pathology and into the rage of human capability
 and most importantly there is a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
 so it's not about de valuing or negates these more trying times as something we want to a void or sweep under the rug but instead signed those opportunities
 rapt in the adversity so may be the idea and what it put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
 embracing it grappling with it these a rustling term may be even dancing with it
 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful were less burdened by the presence of it
 miss year befel ob the two hundred birthday of charles darwin and it was a hundred fifty years ago when writing about evolution but darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
 to paraphrase it not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent but survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
 conflict is the genesis a creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
 if driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we know we're made of maybe doth of adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
 maybee we can see it is change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves too yet
 i think the greatest adversity that we created for ourselves is this idea of normal sey
 there who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
 there's no normal and would you on meet that poor baas person if he existed i'll think so if we can change this paradise from one of
 achieving normality to one of possibility or potency of even all it more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
 they rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologist tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
 there's evidence that neander falls sixty thousand years ago carried they elderly and those with serious physical injury
 and perhaps it's because the life's experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
 they did view these people as broke in and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red sone and dort eastern pennsylvania
 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes at a summer time i had short done i heard the sky whose voice behind me say well if it isn't aim in mullins
 i turned around and this his older man i have no idea who is and i say d i'm sorry sir i don't
 how we mad i i don't remember meeting you he said will you would remember meeting me may when we met are was delivering you from your mother's whom
 oh that ye eye if ner and before i actually
 it did click this man was doctor key a man that had only known about to my mother's stories of that day because of course
 typical fashion i arrived late from my birthday by two weeks and so my mother's prenatal physician had gone in occasion said the man who delivered me for a complete stranger to my parents
 and because i was warm without the civil of bones and had feet churned in a few toes in this foot if putz in that he had been the bearer the stranger
 had to be the bearer of that news he said to me and i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kiss have or any kind of life's independence and you've been maken a liar at an me ever since
 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
 whether winning a second rate spelling bee marching with the girl's gouts which be not the hollowing trade winning like holland's dollars ship or any of my sports victories
 and he was using it in interpreting an dude teaching a resident students med students from hahnemann
 medical school and hersey maples f and he called this part of the course the ex factor there was potential of the human will
 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be in it as a determinate in the quality of someone life
 and doctor king went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
 and even if given a mum modicum of support is left to their own devices a child will achieve
 so doctor king made that shift and thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what some one might do with it
 son's been a shift in my thinking overtime and that if you'd ask me as fifteen years old if i would have traded prophetic for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
 i aspired to that kind of normal sey back to them if you asked me to day i'm not so sure
 and its because of the experiences as had with them not in spite of the experiences as had with them
 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because ive been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cap shadows on me
 all you really need is one person to show you the epic many of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves is a the exact meaning of the word educate
 comes from the rue word add deuce it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
 there was a case dy done in nineteen sixty britain when they were moving from compt o grammar schools to comprehensive spools called the streaming child who call it tracking
 here in the states its separating students a d c d and so on
 and near the a students get the toper quickly limb the best teachers et cetera what we took over a three month period de level students gave maize told them they were raised told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
 they were performing at a level of course the heart raking foot side of the study is that they took the a students
 and told them they were dease and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school size the drought people had dropped out
 missus a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped to
 the teachers in nose which had been made they were simply told these were the asians these are the deston and that how they went about teaching them
 and treating them though i think
 at the only true disability
 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity in our innate ability to imagine
 if instead we convulse her a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities in new ways of being
 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named happy
 and my friend jack them bois told me not and a poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
 has known god not the god of names not the god of dotes but the god who only knows forwards
 and keep repeating them saying come dance with me come am dance with me thank you
 hanging the taal to day about energy and climb it
 and that might seem a bit surprising because mindful time work at the foundation is mostly about back seams and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest too billion live better lives
 but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet
 the climate getting worse means that many ears their crops won't grow but be too much rain not enough rain
 things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads starvation leads uncertainty it leads unrest al so that the climate changes will be terrible for them
 also the price of energies be importing to them in fact you could pic just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time
 i really an advanced civilization i was based on it advances and in energy a cold revolution bled
 the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price electric he on that why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make our modern materials and do so many things
 and to werner that wonderful situation with a electricity in the rich world
 but as we make it cheaper and let's sail its go for making a dug twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint
 in that constraint has to do with seal to seal two is warm in the planet
 and equation on co too is actually of a very straightforward one did you sum up the seal too that get submitted
 that leads to a temperature increase and that temper d increase leads some very negative effects the affects on the weather
 i perhaps worse the indirect effects in that how the i natur legal systems can't adjust these rapid changes and so you get echo system claps this
 now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of seal too
 to what temperature being where the positive the bets are there sum uncertainly there but not very much and there certainly in certainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
 i ask the top sime to send u several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just it'll cut it half for a quarter and answer is that until we get near to zero
 the temperature will continue to rise and so that's that's a big challenge it's very different then saying in a word twelve foot high trot trying to get under a tent foot bridge and we can d sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero
 now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year how over twenty six billion tons of for each american
 it's about twenty tons how for people in poor countries it's less than one tim to average about five tons for every one on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero
 it's been constantly going out its only very economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to fall in and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors
 i low bit i multiplication so've got it thing on the laft sal too want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number people
 the services each person using on average the energy on average freight service and the seal too being put out
 a pert unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero i'll probably one of these numbers is go to have to get pretty near to sero
 how that's back from eyes go out or to let sleds take the look how first we got population
 how the world to day has six pointed billing people that's headed up to about nine billion now we do a really great job on new back scenes health care
 reproductive hell service as week of laura that bight perhaps ten or fifteen per cent but there we see an increase of a about one point three
 the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food weed
 clothing t d a heeding these are very good things a getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost every one on the planet and it's a great thing
 out for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year
 this number on average is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person
 can we have the very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your home market and fact these kid stops of theyre going out and reading their schoolwork under the street lamps
 now efficiency e the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that s knock goin up through various inventions in new ways of doing lighting
 i threw a different types of cars on differ ways of building buildings they're lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially
 some individual services even bring it down by ninety per cent there are other service as like how we make f eliza how we do ere transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
 and so overall here if were optimistic we may get a reduction of above a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of six
 but for these first three factors now we've got from twenty six billion to it best i maybee thirteen billion tons and that just won't caught it so let's look at this fourth factor how there's good to be a key one
 and this is the amount of seal two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero ah if you burn coal
 no up you burn natural gascon almost every way we make electric you today i except ah for the emerging nobles and nuclear i'll puts out seal too ands what it' are going to have to do it a global scale
 is pre a new system and we need energy miracles now when it is the turmeric i don't mean something that's impossible
 the micro process is a miracle the personal computers a miracle of the interstate services are miracle so the people here participated in the cretan of many miracles usually but will have a deadline
 where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don this is a case but we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in ain't a pretty tight time line
 i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here
 i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow not people enjoyed that
 have really got them involved in the idea ah you know other people live in scat so with energy all i could come up with is this ah i decided the releasing fireflies
 would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here ever some nat reply flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not you believe that jar ha
 now there's all sorts of gimme g solutions like that one ah but they don't really add up to much we need solutions either one or several that have
 unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there is many directions or people seeking i really only see five that
 can achieve the big numbers i've left out tye gill thermal usin bibles those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my keep point here
 is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them ah because they they looked haunting because they all
 have significant challenges i'll let's look first at the burning fossil fuel either on burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there
 seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the seal too after you burn it going out the flue prest rise at creta liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
 now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixteen eighty per cent level begetting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these seal tooth quantities should be put
 we'll be hard but the tough as one here is this long permission who's get a be sure who's going to guarantee
 of something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of them in terms of nuclear other things this is a l a volume
 so that's a top one next it be new glove it also has a three big problems clasps particularly and highly regulated countries is high
 they issued the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that he did not go got these human operators that the fuel
 doesn't get used for weapons and then where what you do with the waste although it's not very large other lot of concerns about that people need a feel good about it so three very top problems how that might be i so livable and so should be worked on
 the last three of the five by group together are these are what people often refer to his the renew able sources and they actually
 follows great they don't quire fuel they have some disadvantages what is that de density
 an energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming
 sir talking not many square miles thousands of times more area than it than you think of its in normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources a the sun doesn't shine
 all day doesn't find every day and likewise the wind doesn't wall all the time and so you depend on these sources
 you have to have some way of getting energy during those time carriage that it's not available so we've got big costs challenges here
 ah we have transmission challenges for example save this energy source outside your country i not only need the technology but you have to i do with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem
 and to d bali see this i went through and looked at all the types of bathers that get made for cars for computers for fogs for flash hits for everything and compared that
 to the amount to elect lan orgy the world uses and what i found u that all the batteries we make now c store less than ten minutes
 of all the energy and so in fact we need a big break through here something that's going to be
 a factor of a hundred better th the approaches we have now it's not it's not impossible but it's not of your easy thing now this shows up when you try to get there the intermit source to be bob say twenty to thirty per cent
 of what you're using if you're counting not it for a hundred per cent you need a and incredible miracle battery
 now how are going to go forward on this what what's the right approach is at a band hatton project what's the thing that can get us there when we need wants
 of companies of working on this hundreds in each these five paths we need least a hundred people a lot of a i look and say they crazy oh that's good
 and i think here in night ted rope we have many people ah who already pursuing this a
 bill gros has several companies in clew one called e solar that has some great solar thermal technology a benoy pulses investing and dozens of companies ah that are doing great things and have an interesting possibilities and i'm i'm trying to help back that i need the marble than i actually are backing at a company
 that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the new clear approach of there are some innovations in nuclear mar dier liquid
 ah an innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago to the idea that there some good ideas lay around ah is not all that surprising the idea of terra power
 is that instead of burning the part of uranium the lum per cent is u two thirty five we decided will let's burn the ninety nine per cent
 thee two thirty eighth it is kind of a crazy idea and that people had talked about it for a long time
 but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it through the advent of modern super computers that now you con simulate and see that yes with the right
 materials approach ah this looks like it would work and because you're bringing that ninety nine per cent i you have
 ah greatly improved cost i profile you act shall burn up the waist and you connect you use his fuel all the left over waste from to day's reactors and so instead of warring about them it jes take that it's a great thing
 it breeds this uranium as it goes along so cutty like the candle and seats it's a log there are often referred to us a travelling wa rector and terms a fuel
 ah this really solves the pom i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over the ninety nine per cent were they taken out the part they b n now so's called the pleaded geranium that would power the s
 for hundreds of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process yet of enough fuel for thee entire life time the rest of the planet so
 ino it scot watts lots of challenges it had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
 so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card i'll look like let's go out to where we really need to get and and then i looked at the intermediate for twenty fifty if heard many people talk about
 this eighty per cent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty per cent will be used up by
 things going on on poor countries still some agriculture a hopefully we will have cleaned up a forest re cement upso to get to that eighty per cent the developed countries
 concluding countries like china will have had the switch their electronic electric to generation altogether also the other greatest are we deployed
 this zero mission technology i've be deployed it in all the develop countries and were in the processes of getting it out elsewhere that superimposed
 that's the key element of making that report card so backing up from there lectured the twenty twenty report card looked like
 will it again it should have the two elements and we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we admit the less that sum will be of sealed to and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there
 doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or made even slightly less important than the other which is the peace of inundation
 on these breakers these breakers we need to move those at full speed and we com measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulator the things that had been chained
 there's a lot of great books the men written about this the alcor book our choice and the david mackay book the state of energy without the hot air they really go through it i think con graded a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this
 others a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that
 we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifth years i com pick whose president i can pick a back scene
 which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost would no seal two gets invented
 this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact and we don't get this wish the division between the people who think short term along term will be terrible
 between you us in china between poor countries are rich and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse s what we have to do what am i appealing at ti da i step forward and
 and dry we needed to go from war research find me and when countries get together a places like hope and hang nation
 just es gus the seal too they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously l levels of spending
 on these innovates approaches we eat do need the market and sent us seal two tags capt tray something that gets that price signal out there
 we need to get the message up to need have this vial i be more rash or more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you
 i du ideot
 back yo arm sitter and the some more about about t terra power write aha
 moved for sort walk can give a since what said the scale of investment this is
 but t the action do this soft where by the super computer hire on the great scientist which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out
 ah in a rush reactive to make sure that are materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundred millions the topping is building a pilot rector
 ah finding the several billion of finding that the regulator that location that will action build the first one of these one should get the first one built
 if it works as advertise then it's jes clear as day because the economics the energy dens he are so different then knuckles we know
 and so to understand it right this revolves building deep into the ground and was like like a vertical can a columne of nuclear fuel of the suspend drane one and then in an end the possess starts at the top and cannot works down
 right to day you are always refilling the react racy of lots of people and lots of controls that to go wrong the thing are opening it up and moving things in and out that's
 that's not good so you had very very cheek yule then you can put sixty years and just think it is a log
 put it down and not ham tho same complexities and it just sit there in burns for the six years ah and the end then it's done
 its it said newly a pow pom that is its own waste disposal sedition
 yellow wood hemans with waste you can you can light it sit there ah there's a lot less waste under this approach ah then you can act you take that and put it into another one and burn that
 and and we start out actu by taking the waist that exists to day that sitting and these cooling pools are bright tasking by reactors that's our fuel
 to begin with so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors as actually what gets that in ours in your reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you going through this process
 haven't you talking to different people around the word about the possibilities here but where is there most interest in actually doing something with us
 while amon i picked a particular place god and there's all these interesting disclosure rules how by any it's called lucia
 at wit we've got a lot of interest ah the people from the company have been in russia india china i've been back seen the secretary of enter to hear talking but how this
 i fits into the the energy of gender some optimistic a of the pinch and japanese have done some more this is a a variant on something that has been done its in important
 advanced but it's like a fast rather and a lot of cup of countries built them so anybody used on a fat trapper is a candidate too to be where the first one gets built
 so in in your mind a time scale and likelihood while actually taken settin like this life
 what we need for one of these
 high scale or liker electoral generation thinks that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deployed that sort of the dead line
 that the admire modus and by mel modus have had have shown us that we have to meet and in oa power if things go well
 how which is wishing for lot could easily meet dot and there are a fortunate now dozens of companies we needed to be hundreds
 who likewise if their science goes well if they finding for their plant pilot plants goes well that they they can kep for this and its basket multiple succeed because any views a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed
 mons of big scale possible game changes that is the biggest that yore a where about there
 an energy break through is the the most important thing it would have been even without the environs metal confront that the inquire mel conflict is makes that soul much
 much greater in the newcomer's facer are other innovators ah and we don't know their work as well as we know this one but
 the mod leer people how that's a different approach there's a liquid type reaction which seems little harder the lady they say got us
 and so that there are different ones but the de beauty this is a molecule radium has a million time as much energy as a molecule of sa cole
 and so if you can deal with the negatives which was essentially the radiation the footprint and costs the potential and terms a effect on land and various things is in almost in a class of its all
 if this doesn't wor
 then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to chine keep the temperature of the out stable
 ye ye get into that situation it's like
 have here
 you've been overeating and hereabout t have a hearted tap in a then then then where you go you may need hard surgery something there is a line of research on was called to you engineering
 which her various took makes that would delay the heating tobias twenty or thirty years to get her act together
 now you hold decks just and in transport you hope you don't need to do that some depot say you should even work on the entrance prosy because it might make you
 lazy that you'll keep eating because you no heart surgery will be there to save you i'm not sure that's wise given the importance of the problem but
 others now that the jeering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case lings happen faster fore this innovation goes a lot slow than we expect
 climate sceptics if you had term a sentence or two to say to them how how might you to swear them that there
 well unfortunately the sceptics come a different camps i mean that ones who make scientist garments are very few
 in odor are they saying that theres negative feed back effects habitue with clouds that off set things they're very very few things that they can even say in others a chance in a million of those things the main time you have here
 it's kind like e do you make them a stake now and you paid for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now
 that has through the game later and a somewhat uncertain a painting in fact the i piece sea report know that
 that's not necessarily the worse case and there are people in the ritual de look at i pie c and sail k and know that that isn't that b good deal the fact is it' that uncertain part
 that should move us towards us but my dream heare is that if you can make it a cana make and meet the seal to constraint them the sceptic sail c
 i don't care that it doesn't put out sea to my kind of wish it did put out sill to but i guess i'll accept because it's cheaper

 sir i'm no lot of fish in my life
 have loved only two
 at first one was zach
 it was more like a passionate affair hair
 and was a beautiful fish
 flavour ful textured her
 needy a best hour on the meuse water fish
 even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustain nobility
 seek if you'll good about selling up
 i was in relationship with disputing me for several months
 one day the head of the company called and asp i speak out it a man
 about the farm sustain ability absolutely i said
 it was a company shining to sell
 what become this unimaginable problem freshest
 have we keep fish on our menes
 for the pass f to year sir we not fishing the seas
 like we clear cut for us
 it's hard to overstate the directress
 nine feet per cent of like fish the ones we love the tun as the hal bits salmons sod fish the claps there was nothing left
 so for better a worse sir agriculture fished find me he impart of our future
 a lot of arguments against it
 fish arms hog
 most of them doing but and they're inefficient take to them major drawback
 get a feed combers glacial of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm timer
 not verse of sam then taste margate ely
 senor finally
 was the company trying to do it right i wanted this afford him
 the day before the advance i call the head of pillar for the company
 let's go him dot
 down i such as to get the fact stay you dies are famous fur for farming so far out to see you you don't polyp that's ready say where's so far out
 the waste of my fish gets distributed
 not concentrated and then he added her
 or basically a world unto our sales
 a few commerson ratio to point find the one he said best in the business
 too poin finder and great i to but i'm like what would you feeding to stain them a protein he said
 right i said got off upon
 and that night i was lying in bad i thought
 what their house is sustain on the frighten
 said the next day just before the event i called thy said now what of some examples of sustain able protects said edith le
 he would ask around why down on the fall if you kep on the company no one can give you straight answer
 until finally i down the horn with the head by august
 was got him down too
 done i said what are some examples of sant of optics
 we he mentioned some al dees
 and some fish meals and then he said chicken palace
 a chicken pots he s yea fella skin
 bow mum scratch dry and processing depity
 then what per sant engine
 of epine this chickadee
 thinking en two per cent
 that's about thirty per cent he said
 as a dan
 what's a state of bow about beating chicken fish
 but there is a long pars on the line
 and he said there'd just too much chicken in the wealth
 i fell out of love with this fish
 not because um some self righteous goody too shoes footy
 actually and
 i fell i a mot of the course because i swart about ashen that conversation and fish tasted my chicken
 the second fish
 but different pal od story
 it's the romantic kind
 a kind where the more you get in know your fish we'll love the fish
 i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain
 a journalist random in talking about this fish for a long time
 she count u set us up
 he came to the table a brier
 almost simmering my collect
 the shaft had over cut their like twice of amazingly it was still and delicious
 who can make up their stays gun
 after its been over cooks
 i can't the brisky cast
 let's call him miguel actually his name is miguel
 a knocking aint cock the fashion he's not a shaft at least in the way that you and i understand it
 is a biologist
 and the la papa it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain
 it's at the tip of the bottle a can bere river
 until the a crones the farm was in the hands of gard tins
 they raised beef gad or almo was essentially wet last
 they did it by draining land they built this intricate series of canals
 and they pushed water off galen and out into the river
 but i couldn't make it worker i economically
 and e classically it was a disaster
 kilt like ninety per sent in of bergs which to this place the lot of birds
 and so a night and ey too
 spanish company with an environmental conscience purchase the land where did they do he
 they were burs a flow of water they bitterly flicked the sweat
 said a pushing water out her
 they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals
 they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fun
 bas mullet shin via
 andy in the process miguel and this company
 completely reverse the ecology of structure
 the farm's in credit her i mean you'd never seen anything liked us
 stare out at an horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshlands
 i was there not long though with mee ah
 he's an amazingly
 like three far tiles dar in and one part cock it out done be
 a yet
 fy are sliding to the wet land
 i am panting and sweating up mud up to my knees and the gle is calmly conducting the violate e lecture
 here is pining out a rare black shoulder cape
 now we've mentioning
 the mineral needs of fido points
 and here mercies a grouping tatter that reminds him of the tans anian juras
 turns out miguel's fat the better part of his career in the make mi national part in effort
 i asked him hind became such an expert on session said session
 mine annoying about pish
 on an expert in relationships
 and then is all
 launching at the more talk about rare burgs and ages in strange applied glance and don't get me roc i was really fascinated you now the bio communed the un fluke kenna fan you know scraper
 but i was aloft and my head
 was swooning over that over cooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before so i interrupted i in the gala makes your fish taste so good
 he pointed the algy
 i know do the algy the fight or plank fin the relationships it ses amazin
 right for ly of this eating and what's the fee converse in ratio
 we went on to tell mad
 at such a rich system
 that the fish are eating with a eating in the while
 the plant mile mass fi up by the zu finon it's what deeds the fish the system is so helping it's totally self for doing
 there he is no feed
 ever heard of a farm the dozen feed its animals
 bitter that day i was driving round this property with me gown i asked him my said per place it seemed so natural
 and life any fish for alley farm might ever be at
 with the honey measure success
 at that moment as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flaming us
 a literal pink carpet f as far as you could say
 that's success he said
 look at their valleys thinking they're feasting
 tasting tolly confuse i sid me get i'd be feasting on your fish
 yes suse earth
 we lose twenty per cent of our fish and fish eggs de berks
 by the last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on
 more than two hundred fifty different species its become to day the largest
 and one of the most important
 private verd sanctuaries in all of europe
 said miguel isn't a thriving bird population like the last ringing want on a fish form
 he shook his hend now he said
 we farm extensively
 not intensively
 this is an ecology will network
 flaming goes beat the sharp the shin beat the fight of langton so the pink and a belly the better the system
 i guess let's renew a farm a dozen feed of dom hoss
 and a farm that mass a success
 and the helth of its prejudice
 a fish farm but also bird sanctuary
 on bila lades fooling those they shouldn't even be there in the first glace
 they brood in a town a hundred fifty miles away where the sol conditions are better for building us
 every morning they fly one hundred fifty miles into the farm
 and every evening they five hundred fifty miles of back
 they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line up highway eight ninety two
 no feta
 and i was imagining a march of the penguins thing enough so i looked at m gal i said
 miguel do they fly one hundred fifty miles to the farm
 and man do they fly on her fifty miles back at night
 th they do that for the children
 he looked at me like i discordant a whitney used himself
 he said na they duk as the foods better
 i didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish
 which was delicious and i don't like fish skin i don't like it seared i like it crisp peaks
 as that acrid tar like flavor
 i must never cook with it
 yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like the skin
 a taste in sweet and clean
 like you were taking a bite av ocean
 mention that to mamy nodded he said the skin at saw the sponge the last offence before enters the body pit and valve
 to soak up in cur ties and then he added
 but our water has no impurity
 a gay a farm that doesn't feed its fish
 a farm the measures is success
 by the success of its planters
 and that i realise what he say sir
 a farm that has no impurity he made a big under statement because the water that clots through that farm comes in from the bottle co your river
 to river the carries with him all the things the rivers tend to carry these this
 chemical contaminated pest side run off
 and when it works its way through the system
 and leaves the water this cleaner than wet an enter
 the system is so healthy it purifies the water
 and not just a farm a dozen feet at h was not just a farm the measures a health
 made it success by the helth of its creditor
 but a farm this literally a lot of purification fl
 and not just for those fish
 but for you and me as well because when n water leaves it dumps out into the latter
 a drop in the ocean i know but i'll take it and so should you
 because this love story
 are of romantic is also instructive
 you like say it's er recipe for the future of good food
 whether were talking about mass or beef cattle
 what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good
 what plan ana people
 that's a bit two radical
 were not real s asp punts
 were lumm as
 we love harms markets we love small family farms
 we stalk about local food wheat our gan ac
 and when you suggest these in of things that will insure
 the future of good food some one somewhere stands up and says heger
 now well thankful ning us hang off he dro o her
 h are anything the worlds can i be asked i don't love that question
 no not because he already produce enough calories to more than fee the world
 one billion peep all
 we'll go hungry to day one billion that's more than ever before
 because of gross inequalities and distribution not hunch
 the idol love this question because it determined the logic of our food system the last fifty years
 green herbivorous
 past the eyes hy mono cultures chemicals to soil chicken the fish
 and all long aground business has simply asked
 if for feeling where people more chiefly how terrible of that me
 that's been the motivation s been the desiccation it's been business fly
 american agriculture we shall call what it is
 business in liquidation
 business that's quickly a rooting ecology capital that makes that very production possible
 a son of business and his anger f whatcher
 our bread basket is threatened to day not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
 not by the latest combine and chapter invention but by fertile land
 not by pounds but by fresh water
 not by chain saws but by forest and not by fishing boats a nat but by fish in the sake one of you the world
 let's start by asking haven't a feed ourselves
 or better her how could we create conditions that enable every community
 to feed it's of
 and do that don't look
 at the agra bis it's model for the future it's really old and its tired it's high on capital chemistry and machines
 and it's never produced anything really good dee
 in stand let's look to the ech logical mato
 that's to one that relies on two billion years
 upon the java curious
 farm to art world into themselves
 farms there
 restore instead of delete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively
 farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships
 is there the once
 their experts in flavor too
 and if i'm better be really honest
 there better shaft than all ever be
 y i'm mook go with that
 because it that's for future good food it can be delicious thank if
 heaven but thoughts about happiness these that
 i had somebody couched the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years
 and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
 there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among we sir true there is a lot of happiness sculp ring everybody would like to make people happier
 but in spite of all this flood of word and there are some l cognized traps that's though make it almost impossible to think straight above happiness
 and i talk to day will be mostly about these cognized traps those supplies do lay people think him of their own happiness only the picter scholars thinking about happiness beetle it turns outward just as must stop as anybody else's
 the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity turns out that the word happiness is just nothing useful word any more because we applied to too many different things
 i think there is one particular meaning foot to which we might restrict it but by a lodge this is something that will have to give up and will have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is
 the second trap is a confusion between experience in memory may separate between being happy in your life and being happy about your life will happy with your life and those are two very different concept and are bull plumped in the notion of happiness
 and the third is it's the focusing illusion and its the unfortunate fact that we can think about any circumstance that effects will be without distorting its importance am this is a real cognized trap there's dressed no way of getting it li
 now i'd like to start with an example of a somebody
 what a question and answers serf and after one of my lectures
 reported a story and that with a story he said he had been listening to a symphony
 and it was at slav glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching cell and then he added we required emotionally
 it ruined the whole experience
 but the taverns
 when it had ruined whether memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten keep
 and what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in toms of two selves ah there is an experiencing self
 who lives in the present
 and knows the present capable of reliving the past but basic lie has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know in the doctor us does it hurt now when i thought you here
 and then there is a remembering self
 and remembering self as the one that keeps score
 and maintains the story of all life and it's the one that the doctor
 approaches in asking a question
 how have you been feeling lately o how is your pre turban thea suff like that those are two very different entities in experiencing self
 and yet and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of a miss about the notion of happiness
 now that remembering self
 is a story teller and that really stops with a bas sick
 response of our memory starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story
 and let me begin with one example
 this is an old study those are at for patience undergoing a painful proceed lel going to deter it's no longer painful these days but it was painful w the sixth when the study was running the ninety nineteen
 thereas to report on their pain of we sixty second and here are too patient those other they according and who are us
 who of them sufferd more and it's a very easy question in clearly patient be sufferd more his colonos copy was longer and every
 minute of pain that pays from a had pay frient b had and more but now there's another question
 homo keep these patient faint they suffered
 and hear the surprise
 and the surprises that patient a had a much worse memory at the colonos scope then patient be the stories of the colonos scopes were different
 and because a very critical part of the stories how it ends
 and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is this thing but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse if the one where pain was of its speak at the very end
 it's a bad story how do we know that because we ask these people after their colin alco pia much later two how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for a than for be in memory
 not this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of year the experiencing self clearly be had a worse dime
 now what you could do with patient a and we are truly van triticum experiments and it h been done and it does wor you could actually extend the colonos copy of patient a by just keeping that you been without dragging it too much that will
 that will cause the patient too suffer addressed a little and much less than before and if you do that for a coup of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will soft
 and you've made the remembering self of patient a a lock better off because now you have endowed patient a
 with a better story about his experience
 what there finds a story
 and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up and what defines a story are changes significant moments and envying e beings are very very important and in this case you of the ending dominate
 not the experiencing self lizard s life
 continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward
 they are lost for ever mean most of the moments of all life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know n in a life they are ab six hundred million of them in a month there about six hundred thousand
 muss of them don't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self
 and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count
 that what happens during these moments of experience is all life
 it's the finite resource that less spending where we are on this earth
 and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have these
 remembering self and the experiencing self and their really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of tie
 from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then
 the two weak vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation had snub the weight works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self a two weak vacation is barely better
 than the one weak vacation because there are no new memories added you have not framed the story
 and in this way time is actually the credible variable that distinguishes are remembering self from our experiencing of time has very little impart on the storing
 now the remembering soft as more than remember until storing it is actually the one that makes decisions
 because if you have a patient has had set tucuman oc bes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then
 the one that chooses the one that has in other memory that is less lad and that's the trip the surgeon that would be chosen
 the experiencing self have no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future
 we don't think of a future nom ony as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories
 and be sickly you can look at this uns a tyranny of the remembering self
 and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self to experiences that the experiencing self does a meet
 i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case that is that its
 we we go on vacations to a very logic extent in the solves so our rememberings
 this is a bit heart to dress afire fight and you know
 comet for we consume our memories that is well of the explanation that is given for the dominance of the remembering self and
 when i think about that i think about a vacation we had an attic a few years ago which was clearly the vest officers of aver harp and i think of a dread of be often
 relative to how much i think of other vacations and
 i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trips i would suffer about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour
 ah that is three weeks and that is at most a hour and a half
 there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in our in hired appetite i have for consuming memory but even if you do more of e
 there is a genuine question
 why do we put so much wit on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you do think about a sole experiment
 imagine that for your explication you know that that we end ina the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed
 and you'll get in a music drug so that you want remember it now would you choose the same vacation
 and and if and if you would choose a different vocation
 there is a conflict between your two selves and you need to think about how to adjudicate the conflict and it's actually mot at all obvious because if you think it terms of time
 then you get one answer and if you think in terms of of memories you might get another answer
 why do we pick them the locations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with the choice between the two cells
 now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness are are really to concert of happiness that we can employ one per self
 and a so you can ask how happy is the experiencing himself and then you would ask how happy of the moments in the experiencing self life
 and there are happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what of the emotion that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of
 getting pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self of the time
 if you ask for the happiness in the remembering self it's a completed different thing this is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life
 very different notion any one who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of scum is of well being
 who been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way that the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self had been recognized in recent years
 and there are no efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization has a world pole with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about
 their experiences and there there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent year we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves
 and the main lesson i think that we have lear if are theyre really different
 you can know i'll satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much above how happily their living their life
 and v versa you not just to give your sense of the correlation the correlation is about point fight with that means is it you meant somebody and you would total his father is six feet tall
 would how much would you know about his height well you would know something about his height but there's a love of uncertainty you have that much from certainty if i tell you that somebody
 rank their life ate on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self
 so the correlation is little we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goulds are their import we know that happiness if mainly
 be satisfied with people that we like
 spending time with people that we like their other pleasures but this is dominant so if you want to maxim size the happiness of the two sells you are going to end up doing very different things
 the balan line of what i said here is that we really should not think of happiness a as a substitute for well bee it is a completely different notion
 now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that
 we do not attend the sin to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california
 ah you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if if say you live in all ah and
 and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california in other places
 and that contrast says and climate while it turns out the time it is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very import to the reflect herself that the sites are happy people l
 but now because the reflective self as int trial
 you may end up some people may end up moving to california and is sort of interesting to trace what is good to happer to peep we move to can ivories in the hope of getting happier
 where their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that
 but one thing will happen they will think they are happier
 because when they sink about it they'll be reminded that how horrible the weather was in ohio
 and they will feel they made the ride b sister it is very difficult to think straight about well being and
 i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you
 a
 hing anxious much now when we were on the fo now jimmie cid ah
 he mentioned to me that and there was but an instant result came out of that galloped survey
 is that is it suddenly that you can share since de ma few malins left there
 sure ah i think the most interesting resolved that we found in the gallops of his is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found out with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self
 when you have we looked at how ink our feelings very within calf
 and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very od sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it laud represented it sample belong income of six hundred thousand dollars a y
 existed ol
 sixty thousand
 sixty thousand person fifty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappy of the poor v yet above that we get an absolute de flat blot i mean i've really seen line so flock
 clearly what has happened is money does not by your experiential happiness but lack of money solely by the misery
 and we can measure that misery very very clear in turns of us
 the other sir the remembering sir you get a different story the more money you are the most satisfied war that does not hold for emotion
 but doni bat thee un whole american endeavor is welt you know ly fiery the pursuit of happiness
 if people took seriously that finding and it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about
 in ay example taxation policy and soforth is it is a real chance that politicians that the country generally would take of finding like that seriously a one h the policy based on
 you may think that there is recognition of the rule of happiness res tri in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states nor question about that but in the yuki it is happening and in other countries it is happening
 people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of public policy
 going to take a while and it's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have a debate fairly soon how to in hands happiness
 those very different ways depending on how you think and whether you think of the remembering self you think of the experiencing himself this is going to influence policy i thinking he is to come in the unit of states efforts are being made
 to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next de cato to pot lapo statistics
 one it seems tore that this issue well orgy should be
 the most interesting policy especial to track over the next fares like to so much for invention bag rey comets
 many one
 for some time i have been interested in the placable effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is a something bake
 is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have immeasurable effect in certain kinds of studies ah the percival effect just because the person thinks
 that what's happening to them is a farmer su dic or aureum some sort of via for pain management for example if they believe it enough there's a measurable effect in the body called the percival effect something fake becomes something real because of some one's perception of it
 ah in order for us to understand each other i won't start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i must show you out works the s trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least in nineteen fifties ah i learned myself from cup scout magic in nineteen seventies
 i'll do for you and i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explained it gasp so i heard that's the life which you could examine my hand which you could examine
 snow hold the knife in my fists like this i mug at my sleeve back and ought to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm was going to squeeze my wrist right here i
 that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i am squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleep and the object of this is quite simple
 ah i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well
 my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact is held so tightly in placed i can shake it
 and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ca
 so this the trick that i often teach to young children that are interested magic because you can earn a great deal about deception by studying this very even those a very simple trick method logically probably many view in the room know the trick but what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand
 i say am willing to con grapple with my wrist to make youre nothing does upper down my sleeve that is a lie the reason on' holding out to my wrist is because that's actually the secret
 of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger i'd hear my index fingers just gen a ship from where it is to a position
 i knew not like this knife
 nice one
 some one who didn't have a child her it is her ha
 sil gus like this from here i and as i move around my fingers ships and we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in way it processes information it doesn't count one two three groups them but that's not really what this is about right then i open my hand obviously it's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by
 j cane or een l next finger being there and then i closed my finger same thing as i moved back
 this motion can have covers to will you back my finger i take this hand away you give the knife found there's a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors ink now
 what is it half to do with the perceval effect well
 i read a study a a year i'll go that really blue my mind wide open i'm not a doctor a researches of this to me was an astonishing thing
 turns out that if you administer a placid bo in the form of a white pill that's like a as burn shaped sister round white pill it has some certain measurable effect that if you change to form that you give the percival in like you make a smaller pill and colour it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective
 even though neither one of these things has any farmer suit of plates their sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill who know about what
 that really foot me out turns out though that that's not even where it stops if you are have capsules
 their more effective than tablets in any form a coloured capsule that yellow on one end and rid on the other is better than a white capsule osage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills
 by no remember this designs with but the poin is
 these osages have som the glue with it and the former some that your edgy want the ultimate in possibly you go to the needle
 write a syringe for some inert couples seas of some inert something and you inject this indue patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind that it's so much stronger than the white pill as are really this graf are a well also ty of some other time when we have slides the point is
 the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real a parma cubical quality it's only your belief that makes it real
 in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magistrate and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real
 and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hap pan it's very very sharp
 and a i'm going to just stair wise at a tiny bit and
 this is really my flesh this is not damien's special grown flesh that's my skin write there this is not a holly with special effect i'm going to pierce my skin and a run this needle through to the other side
 if you're queasy cuc if cure if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the a hotel room last night some people that i didn't know and one woman not almost passed out so i suggest if you're if you'd get pleasing easy that look away for about the next thirty effect you know it i'll do the first bad part behind you'll get to see you can look away to if you'd like to
 ah so here's what happens for i hear at the beginning in my flesh ah at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce
 i'm sorry rounded i might be breaking out i'll cat and under just through my skin a tiny bit and out on the other side like this
 n essentially were of the same position we were in with the knife trick
 a sort of w her
 but you can't count my fingers fright now canyons men so only show him two that's what two three four five hands
 i know what people think when they see this they go well he would certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes
 only give you little peak
 was that look out there p good
 yard or
 at the people in the back o kay i didn't really see that people in satellite roomer like starting to move in now if we give you a good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a holly wood special effect that's my flesh
 and i can twist the around ab sorry i don't if you're getting creasy look away i don't look at thing
 people ne back her people on fido years are now watching the civilian that looks kind of neat and
 some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be sin as a whole there and hold there if it were real he would be bleeding
 only work up some blood for him
 a
 normally now i would take to me aloud at a clean of my arm i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of
 taking something fake and making it into something real i'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage
 i will be seeing you several times of the next few days i hope you are looking forward to that
 i can leave you with one big idea to day it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater than the sum of the pars and instead of thinking about information overload
 what i'd like you to think about as how we can use information to that patterns pop and we can see turns that would otherwise be invisible to what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age this
 toll that amusing here is a little experiment it's call pivot and with pit it what i can do as i can choose the filter in one particular cause of debt say accidents and right away i see there's a different pattern that emerges
 this is because in the mid era here people are their most active and over here th of the most frailer we can step back out again and then reorganize the dat by cause of death
 seeing that circulatory diseases and cancers of the usual suspects but not for every one if we go ahead and we fill her
 by age say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that pep ought to be worried about
 and we drawn to that it especially to case for mat so you get the idea that viewing information doing gave in this way is a lot like
 swim in and in living information in photographic and if we can do this for raw data why not do it for contents as well
 so what we have right here is the cover of every single sport illustrate it ever produced
 it's all here it's all in the web you can go back your rooms and try this after my time with vivid you can drill into a decade you can drill into a particular year you could not bight into a specific issue
 so looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this is she the sports on a land's farm strong fan so i'll go ahead and on click on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lands are strong is inter part of
 no if i wanted just come of take a peak of these unlight thick well what about taking look at all psyche lens i can step back and expand on that less you grog mamma now
 and so you get the idea that when you navigate of her information this way going narrow broader backing and backing out you're not searching your not brows and your doe something as actually a little big different it's in between m
 we think it changes the way information can be used so i won't extricate on this idea a bit with something of the little but crazy what we've done here is we've taken every single wick acadia page if we reduced it down to a little summary so the summary consists of just little synopsis and the icon in the cate the topical are that it comes from i'm only showing top five hundred most popular w to pity it pages are here but even in this limited view
 we can do one of things right away we get a sense of water the topical domains that are most pot dor and w caped pia i'm then go ahead in slight government
 now having selected government i could now see that the wick of media categories that was frequently correspond to that our time magazine people of the year
 so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wick a media page it's on way possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them looking at one of these particular summarily i can then drill into the concept of
 time magazine person of the ear bringing up all of them so looking at these vehicle i can see that the majority come from government
 some have come from natural sciences
 some you you are still have come from business
 there's my boss and a
 one has come from music
 and interestingly enough bono was also ted prizes winter
 so we can go jump and take a leg of all ted prize winners so see we're navigate angle wed for the first time as if its actually web not from page to page but at a higher level of abstraction
 and so i want to show you one of the thing that m catch you loo of it by surprise i'm just showing the newer times wept sid here so pip it this application i don't want to to call the brows is rilling out the browser
 but you can do weet pages with it and we bring thats stable technology to every single wet page like there so i can step back
 pop right back into a specific section now the reason wit is it importance because my virtue of just viewing wet pages in this way i can look at at my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill in to what i've done
 over specific time frames here in fact is the state of all the domo that i just gauge and i consort of replace himself that i was looking at earlier to day
 and if i want to step back and look at everything i can slice and dice my history perhaps by my search history
 here is doing some nepi tic searching looking for being over here from live lapse pit of it and from these i can drew into the wet pays and just launch them again it's one met of four
 re purpose multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with a day di so
 right now in this world we think about data as being this curse we talk about the curse of informed an overload we talk about
 drowning in day done what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down
 so that instead of navy getting from one thing to the next we get used to the habit of being able go from many things to many things and then being able see the patterns that were otherwise hidden if we can do that then instead
 of being tracked and data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge and it's we get the knowledge though may be these from theirs wisdom to be found so that i thank you
 i grew upon steady died of sides fiction in high school i took a bust to school an hour each way every day and of i was always absorbed in a book
 signs fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this a in inner in a narrative formless insatiable sense of curiosity that i had an and of
 in all that drought the also manifests itself and in them
 the fact that whenever i was in in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking
 sam su frogs and snakes and bugs and paw water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was now i was real si speak but was all about trying to understand
 understand the world understand them the limits of of possibility and mayre love of size fiction
 actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happen this was in the late sixties
 ah in all we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the devotions and the jacques sta was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in an ill wondrous world that we could never really have
 previously imagined so that seem to res innate with the whole science fiction part of it
 and i was of an artist i could draw painting and i i found that because there were it ino vidal games in this saturation of sib movies in all this imagery in the medial landscape
 i had to create these images of my head i you know we all did as kid's having too of read a book and through the author's description put something on on the stream the movie stream in our heads and so my
 response to this was to paint to draw alien creature's alien world robots spaceships all that stuff i was in deceived getting busted in math class now dood ling behind the behind the textbook and
 that was the curatives had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened jacques gusto
 shows aught now she got me very excepted ab the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spacious some day that that seemed pretty i'm pretty dar unlikely
 but i could that was a world i could really go to wright here on earth it was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined not off from reading these books
 so ah i decided i was going to become a scoop of diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest dumpty
 but i didn't let that daunt me ah i've pestered my father until he finally found a a scoop class in in the buffalo new york read across the border from where we live
 than as she got certified ah in a pool at a w m se a in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and
 i didn't see the ocean ah a real ocean for another two years until we though we move to california and now since that in o in in the intervening
 forty years ah i've i've spent about three thousand hours under water and five hundred of hours of that was ins submersible and i've learned that that
 that that devotion environment even the shallow oceans of sol are rich with that with amazing life
 that really is beyond beyond our imagination they of nature's imagination is so
 so boundless compared to our own a meagre human imagination i still to this date stand an absolute awe of what i would i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is
 tis i'm going in and just as strong as it ever was but tum one ain't when i chose prayer as in a dull cub
 it was still making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
 this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges to la trade images and i was says a kid constantly drawn comic puts on till fill making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories of
 i chose to tell were size fiction stories terminate their aliens than the abyss and with the abyss ah i i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with fill making soap gim
 merging the two passions something interesting came out of d abyss which was
 that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature
 ah we actually embraced ah computer a generated animation as si shi and
 this a this resulted in the first soft surface character siege animation that was ever in a in a moving
 and eng l shall then make me money oh breon broke even i should say i went to something amazing which is that the the audience to globe alliance was mesmerized by this apparent magic he know its arthur clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical
 and so that that that got me very excited i thought while this is this is something in needs be embraced into the cinema art so with the terminated too which was my next film we took that much farther working with with i lem we created the liquid metal
 dude in that film that that success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work in it did and we created magic again we had the same result on with an adding so though we did make a little more money on that we how so
 the out dry line through those those two two dod suff its of experience came to thus this is going to be a whole new world this is a whole new world of creative thy for
 four film artists so light i started a company with stan wench to my good friends dan winston who is a the the premier make up and and creature designer
 n at that time and it was cod vital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog pat the kind of analogue crosses seas of optical printers and so and and we would go right to digits production we are she did that and gave us a competitive advantage for a while
 but we found ourselves lagging in in the midnight use in the creature in character designed stuff that we had as she founded the company to do
 so i wrote this piece called av tar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
 of our visual effects of si gi effects beyond with realistic art human motive our characters generated in si g in the main carriages of all thei and the world would be in six and d
 yellowed the em low push back and i was told by a lived the folks at my company we warn't to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other moving about a big ship at six
 and you i went in pish it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it's going to be the epic romance passionate
 the film secretly what i wanted to do as i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic and asked why i make the book
 ask the true now steady i didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we going to die to the record of fill it for real will be using it in the opening of the film and be really import of a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition
 sounds crazy but this goes back to the theme about you know your imagination creating a reality there's action created reality where it six months later i find myself in a russian submersible
 two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking up the real titanic through through viewport nut a movie not h d for rear
 how that that blue my mind and you know took a out of preparation we had to build camers and lights and all kind of things but it struck me how much this
 die if these deep dives was like a like a space mission and a where was it was highly technical and a required enormous planning and you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile a environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself
 and you know i i thought while i'm i'm like living in a signs fiction moodie this is really cool
 and so i i really got bitten by the bug of depot and exploration coursed the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity was imagination and it was inexperience
 that holywood couldn't give me cause in all i could imagine creature and we the great a visual effect for it but i couldn't imagine that i was see out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions
 i was seeing creatures at hy thermal van son and sometimes things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before the as she were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them so i was completely smitten by this
 and had to do more and so i actually made a conic curious decision after the successive titanic i set o cane oran a park my day job as a holly wood movie maker and went to go be a full time explorer for a while
 and zen and we started planting these these expeditions and we won up going to the bis mar ken and exploring it with a with the robot vehicles we went back the titanic wreck we took little bots that we had created its spool of fib romp tic
 and that the idea was to go in and do it interior survey of that ship ah which had never been done nobody ever looked inside the recked and have the means to do it so we created technology to do it
 so you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out the planks that l much like this where i knew that the that the band had played
 then i'm flying a little robot ex vehicle through through the corridor of the of the ship youll not what i say of i'm i'm i'm operated it but my mind is in the vehicle
 i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was at the most sere on kano dejah experience hope i've ever had because
 i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i hadn't walked the set from months homer making the movie
 and the set was based as an exact replica on the blue prints of the ship so it was this absolute remarkable experience in it really
 may me realize that the hotel the tell presence experience that you action can have these robot ex avatars than your consciousness
 is is an injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence it was really really quite profound and may be a little bit of a glimpse took to what might be happening me of some decades out as a
 as we start to have a s board bodies for exploration or for other means and in many short of am post human futures that at that i can imagine as a side fixing fen so having done these these zum
 expeditions ah and end you'll really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the depot in vents where we had these
 amazing amazing animals there bait baseball aliens right here on earth they live in an environment of kim synthesis they don't survive
 among sunlight base sis in the way we do and so your seeing animals that are living next to five hundred degrees centigrade water plumes that that you think they can't possibly exist at the same time
 i was getting very interested in spa sides as well again now its the science fiction influence has a kid
 and i wound up getting involved with the the space community really involved with that with massa singing on the massa advice reboc planning a actual space missions going to russia going through the pre cosm up by oedipus and all these sorts of things
 to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three de cam sisters and this was fascinating but what would i one of doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep
 and taking them down so they had access astro biologists planetary science as people who were interested in these extreme of file environments
 taking them down to events and letting them see and take samples and test instruments in sence for here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actu doing spak sides
 i completely closed the loop between being the si fiction fan now as a kid and doing the stuff for real
 and in along the way that in this journey of discovery i learned the lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about
 leadership and i think directors god the leader leader of the own captain ship on swarthy i nearly learn about leadership until
 did these expeditions because i had d at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this what i get out of it
 we don't make money at these damp shows and will we barely break even there's no fame in it people sor to think i went away between titanic and avatars was buffy my nails some place dote sitting out the beach made all these films made all these documentary films that be on for berth
 leonardi has no fame no glory no money what you doing you doing it for the task itself for the challenge
 and the ocean is the most changing environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens
 when a small group of people form a tightly in it tend do we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time
 sometimes at sea for for for two three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing
 is the respect that you have for them that they have for you that you've done a task
 that you can't explain to some one else when you come back to the shore and you say we know we had to do this and the fiber optic in the attenuation that this than that all that all the technology of it and the difficulty to human performance aspects of working at sea
 you can't explain it to people a that thing that that maybe cops have or people and in combat that have gone through something together and they know they could never explain it creaks of blond creeds of bot of respect so when i came back to make my next movie which was av tar
 i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that it you respect your team and you are in their respect in return and i actually chang a dynamic so here i was again with a small team
 and you know an uncharted territory doing avatars coming up with new technology that didn't exist before tremendously exciting a tremendously challenging and we became a family
 over four and a half yer period and completely changed how i do move you so people of conness on how y alike you brought back the och shin organisms and put them on the plan of pandora to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself the change does result of them
 so what can we synthesize out of all this you know what's that what of the lessons learn while i number one is curiosity it's the most powerful thing you own imagination
 is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world
 i have young film makers
 come up to me and say you i'll give me some advice for doing this
 and i said
 don't put limitations on yourself other people do that for you don't do it to yourself don't bet against yourself and and take risks ah an assa has this has this self phrase that they like failure is not an option
 but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration because it's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation
 was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that's the thought i would leave you with is it in whatever you doing failure
 is an opt youre but fear is not that give
 i had on her a game designer i've been making games on mine out for ten years and have my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in all my games
 now i have planned for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time
 playing vigor and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing on mind games some of you might be thinking
 that's a lot of time to spend play games may be too much time considering how many urgent problems we have dissolved in the real world how but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true
 three billion hours a week is not merely enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems h in fact
 i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we new to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week
 sir that's probably bit of a counter into it of idea sir i'll just u say it again let it sink in if we one i saw problems like hunger poverty clime exchange lob will conflict obesity
 i believe that we need to aspire two play names all mine for at least twenty one billion hours a eat by the end of the next decade
 no un serious
 i am here is why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future arrival of the human species truly
 isn't the portrait by if a tother ning phil told ano we wanted to capture the emotion of gaming he said of a camera in front of beam is while they were playing and this is a classic
 gaming emotion now ah if you're not a gainer we might miss some of the new once in the soto you probably see the sense of urgent sea a little bit of
 fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem h if you are a ginger you will notice a few nuances here the crackle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprised this is a gainer who's on the verge of something called an epic when no
 how you heard of that opera so we have some dams among a so an habit wing is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea was even possible until you achieved it ah it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
 and when you got there you're shock to discover what you truly capable up that's an epoch went
 this is a gainer on the verge of an epic wind and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem salvers all over the world as we try attack all the obstacles of the next century the face of some one
 who against all odds is on the verge of an epic wind now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see and every day life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call thee i'm not good at life face and dissect really me
 making it can you say guess good i'm dissecting me making me i'm not good at life face ams a piece of graf di in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my peach d on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of games have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as an successful although that's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but h so mean good as in motived to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and cooperate and when we're in game worlds
 i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves though most likely to help it a moment's notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again um and in real life
 when we swim we face failure when we confine obstacles we often now feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical
 we never have those feelings on were play games be just gone existing games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a guide to a stud it what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we
 take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so looked at games like world of war crop which is really the ideal collaborated problem sobbing environment and i ser its notes a few things that make
 epoch wins so possible in all mind worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up monies all my games especially in wode a fore craft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission
 right away but not just any mission is a mission that is perfectly mashed with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you challenge that you can ach
 but it is only the verge of what you're capable offs you have to try hard but there's no unemployed in road of war craft there's no sitting around wringing your hands is always something
 and important to be done and they're also tons of clave rates everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people
 ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission as not something we have in a realize that easily to sunset at our finger tips our tons of cabs and also this is epic story this inspiring story i were there
 and what we're doing and they me get all this positive fee mappy des a het of levelling up and plus one straying plus once intelligence oh we don't get the kind of constant fee back in your life when i get off the stage i'm not goin to have no plus v speaking and plus one
 crazy idea i'm plus twenty crazy an idea ugh i don't get that see back in her life u now the problem we clap it him on my americans like world of war craft
 is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epine all the time that we decide to spend all a time in these game worlds is just better than reality so so far am collectively all the world of war cop dealers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of azara no
 that's sound u as early a bad th it might sound like as a bad thing but to put that in contacts five plein nine three million years ago was when
 our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate ope so when we talk about how much time re curly investing in plain games
 the only weight makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution um which is an extraordinary thing but it's also apt because it turns out that by spending all the time plain games were actually changing
 what we are capable of as human beings where evolving to be more collaborated and hearty species this is t i believe us so consider this really interesting cat
 it was recently published by return carnaval an university the average person to day in a country with a strong gainer culture
 will have spent ten thousand hours playing on my games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all
 four children in united states ten thousand eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
 so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gainer as your learning about everything else in school
 some of you have probably read mount on glad ball's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hours theory of success it's base on this great proven of saint's research that if we can master
 ten thousand hours of effort ful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuous as as it will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world am and so
 now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people poor virtuoso ams so the big question is
 whats aptly our gainer is getting so good act because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
 this is how many people we had out have in the world who spend at least an hour day playing on my gates these are our virtuoso dem s five hundred million people who are extraordinary good at something
 and in the next decade where dan to have another billion camers who were extraordinary good
 at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consuls that are low energy and that work with the wireless foe net works instead of a broad an inter nett so that games all over the world particularly in india
 china brazil can get all mine to expect one billion more gems and next decade som things have to one point five billion games
 so i started to think about what these games are making us virtuous as at here the four things i came up with
 the first is urgent optimism can think of this is extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
 games always believe but an equant as possible amidst always worth trying and trying now ginger hum set around
 cape camers are virtuoso at weaving a tight social fabric is the lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play again with them even if they beaten us badly
 the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play game with some one we trust that they will spend their time with us they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so plain the game together actually bi up bonds and truss and co operation um and then we actually built stronger social rations ships as a result
 blissful product toity i love it it is a reason why the average world of work haft dam her plays for twenty two hours a week come be half time job it's because we know when more playing a game that were actually happier working hard than we are
 relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimism human beings to do horrid a meaning for work and games are willing to work hard all the time if forgiven the right work finally epic meaning
 finger's love to be attached to awe inspiring missions two human planetary scale stories su is one bit of tourney of the helps put that into perspective um so you all know wh you cede
 biggest wick in the world second biggest wicket in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of work aft wicker
 five million people use at every month they have compiled to more information about world of war craft on the ernest than any other topic covered on any other whisking in the world they are building an epic story they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of war calf a case of these are four super powers that add up
 to one thing games are super powered hopeful individuals
 these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that so problem that i'm trying to solve
 ah there's in the cond missing ever casanova whose work is brilliant he looks at wide people are investing so much time and energy and money in all my worlds
 and he says we're witnessing what amounts to know less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and all my game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says
 not like me again as i'm um exuberant but he says he says
 that this makes perfect sense because deem is can achieve more in all my world than they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better fee back and feel more reward than in games than they do in real life though he says
 for now it makes perfect sense for dams has been more time in virtual worlds than the real world now
 i also agreed that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optical situation we have to start making the real world walk more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened
 twenty five hundred years ago these our ancient dice made out of sheep s knuckles bright before we had awesome game controllers we had sheeps knuckles and ah these are present the first game equipment designed by human beings
 if he familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus you might know this history on which is the history of who invented games and why
 hat tus says that games particularly dice eames were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine
 that the king of lydia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution
 so according to herodotus they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy
 on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and it would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and a mercer in such satisfying wistful prod activity
 they would ignore the fact they had no food to eat and then on the next day they would play eames and on the next day they would eat and according to herodotus
 they passed eighteen years this way surviving they were famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how were using games to day
 were using games to escape real world suffering were using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment everything that's not satisfying about real life
 and we're getting what we needed from games but it doesn't have to end there this is really exciting according to herodotus after eighteen years the famine was in getting better so the king decided they would play one final bis game
 they divided the tire kingdom in half they played one dy scheme and the winners of that game got to go
 on an epic adventure they would leave lydia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind justin of people
 to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take the civilisation somewhere else where they could thrive now this sounds a crazy right
 but recently diane evidence has shown that the etruscans who then led to the roman empire actually shared the same diane as the ancient lidia and so
 recently scientist have suggested that herodotus as crazy story is actually true and geologist have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might have actually
 saved their culture by play games escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and i knew so much about how to come together the games but be actually saved the entire civilization that went how get we can do that
 we had complain war crafts since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time strategy game from the world war cast series that was sixteen years ago
 they played dy schemes f eighteen years lead them playing war path for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now
 they had half the civilization go off in search of the new world so that where i get my twenty one billing hours a week of game play
 from let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour day playing games until we solve real well problems n know your asking
 how are we in sal ruble problems and games well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future
 we have as banner in our offices in pal alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict the future but we wanted to is make the future
 we won't imagine the best case scenario outcome and then we want it in power people to make that outcome a reality we want to imagine epic winds and then give people the means to achieve the epic when
 i'm decided very briefly show you three games that i've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epoch ms in their own features
 to this is world without oil we made us game in two thousand seven this is an awe line game in which you tried to survive an oil shortage
 but we'll short it is fictional but we put enough on my content out there for you to believe that it's real and to live your real life as if we will not of oil so you come to the game
 you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news of the oath dad of feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs what's not available how food supplies being affected how transportation is being affected and if schools are closed if there's vietri and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blob about it
 to post haidi the post photos we piloted this game was seventeen hundred players and two thousand seven and we've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transformed of experience nobody must change how they live just because
 it's good for the world or because repose to but if you and merce him in an epic adventure and tell them
 weve run out of oil this of an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits they were in in the s game
 so for the next whirl saving a decide to aim higher figure problem than just peek oil ah me to the game called superstructure for the future
 and the premise was a super computer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet the sever computer was called the global extinction aware in a system of course we asked people to come our mine almost like a jerry brok mer movie
 no jury by timer movies you forma dream team you've got the ash the scientist the ex convict and they all of something to do to save the world
 but in our games said of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody s on the dream team and at youre job
 to invent the future and energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety n
 we had eight thousand people played that game for eight weeks it came up with five hundred insanely creed of solutions that you can go o mine if cup gle superstructure
 so finally the last game we're launching at march third this is a game done with the whirl bank institute if you can plead the game you will be
 certified by the worl bank institute as a social invader class of two thousand ten working with universities all over subs here in africa and we're inviting them to learn social innovation skills we've got a graphic novel
 we've got levelling up and skills like local insight knowledge met working sustain ability vision and resourcefulness i would like to bite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
 s i've been a rack up now and want to ask a question what do you think happens next we've got always amazing camers we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do but none of them are saved the real world yet
 well i hope that you will agree with me that dealers are in human resource that we can use
 to do real world work the games are a powerful platform for change we have all these amazing super powers blissful prod activity debility to weave a tight social fabric this feeling of urgent optimism in the desire for epic meaning i really hope that we can come together
 to play games at matter to survive on this planet for another century and that's my hope that you will join me in making and playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure
 that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so i say that the world changing games begin thinking
 for ten right hair we have a machine a big machine a cool tetes machine and it's a tine machine and every one in the smouse again into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stammer you are
 and i wonder where you would choose because i've been asking my friend's expression light lightly and they all want to go back i had another one to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idol
 either known i'm i'm convinced of there' some sort of pull to nostalgia to wish ful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i hap to say
 i dont want to go back and it's not because some adventuress it's because possible be on this planet they don't go back to go forward so i want to get him the machine and i want to go forward
 this is the greatest kindness ever than on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health and ralph
 mobility opportunity declining lights of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents
 died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed out number to seventy my parents are closing in un needy so i
 they' bet a deity they're better be an gnawing on the beginning of my doth the number u but it's anyone about people like us because
 this is a bigger deal than that a keep morning ne dully today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago
 make to think about that it an incredible fact and wye or true
 small pots slap pox kilt millions of people on this blin it res shaped the democracy of the globe in a way that no wherever has it's gone
 it's vanished we vanquished it poops and the rich were over
 diseases the threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly dip faria rubel hollo doesn't le even know what those things are
 that scenes modern medicine our ability de feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out
 singeth it works changing it when it does in is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news
 unfortunately that all the gits because there some other province and they've been mentioned many times in one of them is dead
 despite all our apples ments a brilliant people got to bed hungry in this world
 every debt that numbers rising its rising really rapidly and its disgracefully not only that we've used our imagination
 to thoroughly trash this globe pot able water arable land rain forest oil gasp their going away
 and they're going away soon in unless week in a day all way out of this mus we're going away two
 so the questioners can we do that and i i think we can i think it clar that we can make food they will see billions of people without leaping the land that they live on and th we can power this world with energy that does it also destroy it
 i willy to believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that kits me up at night one of the things a keeps me up at night
 we'd never needed progress in science more than we need a right now never and we've also never bid in a position to deployed properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields
 and yet i actually think we have to go back a hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when you battle progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on mar front
 then we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them freight not even the truthful set them fit and listen
 everyone entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to the opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitle to your own facts sorry you're not and mistook me a while to figure out
 about a decade ago i wot a story about that scenes for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effect of public help measure in human history
 i'll know what to do so i've just did but i dill i wrote a string and moved on and um soon after that
 i wrote astray about genetic bally engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so
 i lug story about that too and i couldn't understand why cooper thought this was frank and food why they thought moving all kills around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground
 but kan out i do what i do i woke the story i move gone i mean on a journalist
 we tight we file we go to dinner and spun
 but these stories father mina couldn't figure out wine eventually i did in thus because of those fanatics that were driving the crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were corfu people educated people decent people
 they were exactly like the people in this room
 it just disturb me so much within i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world
 where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to be talk about it and vivid gently we talk about it in ironic turns with little quartz around it progress
 o k there are reasons for that and i think we know with those reasons how we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and know that there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand
 t noble bo paa the challenger
 vi ax weapons of mass destruction and in childs
 oh you know you can choose your mist
 there are questions and problems what the people we us to believe we always right so be scriptural
 ask questions demand proof demand evidence john take anything for granted but here's the thing when you got proof
 you mean to accept the proofs and we're not got good o doing on
 and the reason that i can say that is because where now in an epidemic of fear like one that eyes never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story
 bit min to the epidemic of attis em to the measles monks and rebelled waxing shop
 airy scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of study should have been gon its in a serious issue
 the day that came back the gat came up from the united states from england from sweden from canada it was all the same no correlation no connection not at all
 doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe in it goes we believe what we say what we think we see what makes us feel real
 we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what
 the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here is a thought
 deny that states is one of the only countries in the world where the that sen rate from measles is going down
 that was disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourself it's horrible
 and what kind at what kind of saying happened that we could do thou now
 i understand it i go understand it because lud and what have measles he the one person in the sidings ever see someone die of measles
 doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all r they've happen the hundred sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of nuisance twenty an hour
 but since it didn't hopping here we can put it out of our minds and people like jennie marthy
 can go around preaching messages of fear in illiteracy from platforms like oper and larry king lies
 i make him do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things was seen the same but there almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and need to learn it really soon
 discard was a hero jervis he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us you'll see her no a ani pollio post gone
 not kind the middle not so much his name's poll all sick
 he just develop a road of vat taxing with a bunch of other people it will save the lights of four hundred five hu a thousand
 kids in the developing world every year pretty good right what's good except the pond hose around talking around that scenes and says how valuable they are and the people ought it just stop the winding and exercise it that work sir pause of terrors
 when paul squeaks in at public caring he can't testify without armed guards it gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school
 and why because paul made a bac scene i don't need to say this but taxing sir essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have measles in this country now
 and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids had in a day again because it's just and numbers agin and the notice and a dive measles what ab pole let's have that
 why not a college cross made of line lovely couple each a go and said we know she thought her was little strive ventimore i were stud up before uh
 she wasn't kita that's made her kit against polla no whey fine
 why because we don't have pollio when you know i who didn't have pollio in this country y strada to day a on a media dot on a plane in magus this morning and hes flying to elliot's right noise over ohio
 and he's gin a land in a couple hours gin a mann of car who's get to come to long beach and he's can to ten one of these stop lis and ted dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic diseased we know either because that's to way the world works that's the planet we live on
 don't pretend to ism that we love to wrap ourselves and lies we love to do it everyone take their violence this morning
 a cheese shall do reconcile and the accident to get you go in
 i know you did because half of americans der every day they take the strap and make al turner of medicines in a doesn't matter how often least
 find out thither their useless the date assess at all the time they darken near hear and they almost never do more than that
 took their he more to pertain me billing hows for darky and untold me with you
 partia dar
 why we do that why do we do that like if i understand we paint big farmer we hain't big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our hope care assisting sucks
 it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishment and cold
 and sold deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and were to we run we leap into the arms a big placid
 not soon to asked her i love b we giver
 foot you know it's not it's it's truly serious thing because missed off his crop and we spend billions of dollars on it and i have all shorts of little props here
 none of the pink go and saw it
 acacia sawn a ka don't know what that is what we spending goings of dolls on it its thought
 and you know like when i say the stub people scream at me and as you would care what people do what they want to do it's its amen field gert and you know i are you're wrong because her
 i don't care if it's the secretary nature just
 who saying wh i not to take the evidence of my experts on the mamma grams or some cancer clock who wants to treat his patient
 with coughing animals when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and signs you went up in a place you go on of be
 he went up in cabo and becky south africa he come four hundred thousand his people by insisting
 that beaten garlic and lemon woa were much more effective than the anti rei bal judge we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of needless depths in a country that has been planed worse than any other by this disease
 please don't tell me there no consequences to these things there are their always are now ah
 the most mess ey done the quarter in the middle of ring hour's this absurd battle between
 proponent of jam medical engineer surgeon then the organic a week it's an idiotic debate that has a stock he's a debate about words about metaphors
 it i bog is not science
 every single thing we eat of the grain of rice every spring of parsley every buss or scrap has been modified by man he nother wear cantering in the garden beam
 there wasn't any carlo
 the w christmas truth we made it ball we made her over the last eleven thousand years
 and some of them work and some of the din we go be to the stuff that didn't now we can do any more precise way in their whisks
 absolutely but we can put som like ry mete into rice a mat can help millions of people millions of people prolonged the lads
 you order do that i have to say i don't understand it am we object to do medical engineered food why do we do that but the things i constantly hear are
 to man chemicals pus sides whore moons
 mon culture we don't want gin fields of the same thing it's well
 we don't want company's packing ones we don't want company's owing seeds and g know my once to all of that is yes
 you're right let's fix it it's true we've not a huge fuit problem this is in science
 this has nothing to do bide it's law its morality its pack a stuff in of science isn't accompaniment it's not a country
 it's not even to lang to you it's a process
 it approaches us in sometimes it works and sometimes it dozens but the idea that we should not allow science to do its jaw because we were a fray
 is really very deaden in its preventing millions of people from prospering you knowe in the next
 fifty years we can have the rose seventy per cent more food than we do right now seventy per cent this is an invent in africa the last three years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why
 genetic bally engineered food we don't want or to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like casa h fern sans casas is something lit calcium people eat a tun like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it socks
 it doesn't have new tuns does an approaching and scientist or engineering all that into it right now
 and then people would be embody even and they'd be able to not go blithe they wouldn't starve and you know i they' g nice but wouldn't be shape o east but it would be nice
 and all i can say about this goose
 why are we finding her why cannon let's ask ourselves wire we found it the cause we don't want to move jeans or this about mining ginger and it's net about chemico
 if not about our ridiculous passion for four moments are insistence on having bigger though better food singular food
 this isn't about rice crisp is about cooing people alive and it's about time we've started to understand without meant because you know something if we don't
 if we continued the up the way we're often we're guilty of something that i don't think we want to be guilty up high capron realism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish
 it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it
 so after this amazingly followed conversation
 y might bought u say it seeing soon again this mid digs congos shining go forward
 and absolutely absolutely i do it struck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we concept that kind if you not any thing we want we can move it where we want and move them
 and we're going to lo it will we want to move it well have to have these conversations and we off to think but when we get in the tim machine and we go ahead
 what did be happen we do i know that we can and as far as unconcerned
 thats something the world needs right enow ha

 one day los angeles times call the steve slopes was walking along the streets of dalton los handles when he heard
 beautiful music and the source was a man
 an african american man charming rugged homeless playing a violin that only had two strength
 and telling a story that many of you know because steve's columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a moodie
 with robert downy junior acting as steve lopez and jimmie fox says nathaniel anthony airs the julia trained double basis whose promising career was cut short
 by a tragic affliction the paramo it spits off here
 nathaniel dropped out of juliet he suffered a complete break down and thirty years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in down to los angeles i encourage all of you to read steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond
 that former gen these two men but how music help shape that bond and ultimately was instrumental if you'll pardoned pon in helping the panie get off the streets
 i met mister ears in two thousand eight two years ago at maltese concho hall he had just heard a performance of beethoven's first in fort symphonies and came back stage and introduced himself was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about joy ma and hilary clinton how the dodges were never been to make the world's series all because up the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethoven's fourth sympathy
 and we got talking about music and i got an emil from steam a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violent lesson with me now i should mention that nat anno refuses treatment
 because when he was created it was with shock there ape and thor seine and handcuffs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
 but as a result now he is prone to these skis orphic episodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding
 and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skid rowe exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
 and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at wales ly constable he had a kind of mani glint in his eyes he was lost
 and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraid i was an lose him that he was in sinking to one of his states
 and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i start a talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic file in pedagog
 so i just started playing
 and i played the first movement of the bit of a milon siren and as i played i understood there was a profound change occurring in the daniel's eyes
 it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible farm acetic of a chemical reaction for which my playing the music
 was its cat list and the fan elf's mani rage
 was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity and grace
 and in a miracle he lifted his own violin and he started playing by ear certain sniff had so violent conjured us which he then asked me to complete mendelssohn tchaikowsky sabellius
 and we started token buck music from bah to beethoven and bronze brook near all the bees from bat took all the way up to acca solomon and i understood the king not only had an encyclopaedic knowledge of music
 but he related to this music at a personal level he spoke about it with a kind of passion and understanding that i share with my palaces in the los angel's philammon
 and through play music and talking about us if this man had transformed
 from the pere annoy disturbed man that had just come from walton the streets of danton's angeles to the charming
 ere you diet brilliant julia transition music is medicine
 music changes us and for nathaniel music is sanity because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his preati any into reality
 and that is an escape from his tormented state
 and i understood this was the very essence of art this with very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental cores our emotions
 and through our artistic lens through our creative any were able to shape those emotions into reality
 and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us inspires and unites usin
 and for nathaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
 the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him
 and i will always make music with nathaniel whether we at walk is he concert hall or on skid row because he reminds me why i became a musician thank you

 and my son knight shameless we stole un chelles sill least forgiven
 self years ago here at ted peter skill mean introduced a design challenge called the martially challenge and the ideas pretty simple teams of four have to build a tallest free standing structure at of twenty sties faggot of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow the marchmont and though it seems really simple it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
 and so i thought this was an interesting idea and incorporated it into a designed workshop and it was a huge success and since then
 conducted about seventy design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the cities of the fortune fifty and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and had like to share some of them with you so
 normally most people begin by oriented themselves to the task they talk about it they figure at what is good a look like they've jockey for power then they spent some time planning organising they sketch in they lay out spaghetti a they'd spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures and then
 finally just as they running out of time some one takes up the marsh mellow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back
 and durham
 they admire their work but what really happens most the time is that the pava turns into an oo h the weight of the marshal causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so
 there are number of people who have a lot more all moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
 they lie that if c they i get distracted if than they produce really lane of structures and of course there esteems that have lot more to their structures and among the best are recent graduates of kinder gart
 a
 thirty mailing as peter tell this hu not ely that that did they produce the tallest structures but to the most interesting structures of them all said the percy when ask is hel come
 why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of us none of the kids spend any time trying to be see e o with paget ink
 wright the gog tie spent time joking for parker there's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find this single right plan
 right and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marsh bellow on the chop they run out of time and what happens it's a crisis
 found familiar right ho k what kine gardeners do differently is that they start with the marsh fellow and they build prototype successive prototypes
 always keeping the marshmallow and tops of the of multiple times add to to fix in a bill prototypes long the waist of his honors recognize this type of collaboration
 as the essence of the irritated process and with each virgin kids get instant feed back about what works and what doesn't work
 so the capac of to play in prototype is is really essential but whats look at how different teams perform
 so the average for most people is around twenty inches business schools didn't s about to half of that lawyers will better but not much better than that hinder barges better the most of belts who does very best
 architects and engineers thankfully and
 thirty nine inches of the tallest structure ha i've seen hi is it because they understand triangles and self f reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building self i reinforce at stable structures
 so i see owes little bit better than average but hears were gets interesting if you put in an executive ad men on the team they get significantly better
 herbal fide wass
 look a round ago out that teams gino in needs have telled before him and whys that because they have special skills of facilitate they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays a close attention to to work
 ah will significantly and improve the teams performance specialise skills and facilitate skills as the combination leads due to strong success
 if you've ten teams said tiff call perform you'll get me be six or so that have standing structures and i i'd tried something interesting i thought let
 up the ante once so i offered a two thousand all their prize of soft word to the winning team so what do you thing happened to these design students what was the result
 years would happen you o
 not one team had a standing structure not one had a if anyone had built say out what one instruct youre later would had taken him there' it interesting that high spaces now have a strong impact we did the exercise again to the same students what you think happen then so now he understand the value of prototypes
 so this same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produced the tallest structures in the least amount a time so there's great lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
 so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time running a martian alow a challenge and the reason as i kelp great dis tools and processes to help but teams build cars and vial games and visual effects a
 and what the marshmallow challenge does as of helps and identify the hidden assumptions because frankly
 every project has its own marsh mellow vesna that the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercising those who are interested may one to go to marshmallow challenged out comments a blob that you can look at how to build at the marshmallows are stepped by step instructions on this at there a
 crazy examples from around the world of how people t weak in adjust the system whose world records that are on this is well
 and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a compact sport ah it demands that we bring all our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking o feeling and are doing to the challenge that we have at hand and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from at an o moment to a tat a moment and that can make a big difference than you her much
